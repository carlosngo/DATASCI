He was fascinating and I suppose being the first one, it was particularly fascinating.\u201d\n"}, {"author": "oestrada", "title": "Can Italy\u2019s Dante have justice, 700 years after his death?", "date": "2021-03-12T09:12:45Z", "content": "Dante\u2019s \u201cDivine Comedy,\u201d considered one of the world\u2019s greatest literary works, came to light after a miscarriage of justice which Italian legal experts now want to correct \u2014 some seven centuries on.\nThe man whom Italians call the \u201cSupreme Poet\u201d was exiled from his native Florence in January 1302, after finding himself on the losing side of a feud between the city\u2019s \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d political factions.\n\u201cOur objective is to assess, in the light of new evidence that may emerge, if these (three) verdicts (against Dante) could be the subject of a retrial, or ideally be quashed,\u201d criminal lawyer Alessandro Traversi told AFP.\nTo do that, Traversi has invited fellow lawyers, senior judges, and prosecutors \u2014 plus the descendants of both Dante and the judge who banished him from Florence \u2014 to reopen the case at a May 21 conference.\nCount Sperello di Serego Alighieri, an astronomer with a direct bloodline to Dante, will take part alongside the scion of Cante de Gabrielli, the judge who exiled the poet.\n\u201cI find it interesting to review this affair,\u201d said the judge\u2019s descendant, Antoine de Gabrielli.\nBut he added that he would not seek to uphold his ancestor\u2019s position that Dante was guilty.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight,\u201d the Frenchman told AFP.\nEven if a full-blown retrial is unlikely to materialize, given all the practical and legal issues, Traversi stressed the value of a symbolic gesture of reparation towards Dante, who \u201clegally speaking, for the City of Florence is still a person with a criminal record\u201d.\nAs well as a poet, Dante was a politician who served as one of Florence\u2019s nine elected rulers, or priors, for a regular two-month term in 1300.\nIt was this post that landed him in trouble.\nWhen the \u201cBlacks\u201d faction retook Florence in 1301 with the help of Charles of Valois, brother of King Philip IV of France, and the support of Pope Boniface VIII, Dante, and other \u201cWhite\u201d priors were tried in absentia.\nIn January 1302, Cante de Gabrielli found them guilty of corruption and political patronage, gave them three days to pay a huge fine, and banned them from public office.\nDante and the others were also stripped of their assets.\nTwo months later, de Gabrielli sentenced them to be burnt at the stake if they tried to return to Florence.\nIn 1315, after Dante refused the terms of an amnesty, another judge changed the sentence to death by beheading, also for the poet\u2019s sons.\nDante survived, roaming from one Italian city to another.\nRelatively little is known about his life, but he is believed to have completed the \u201cDivine Comedy\u201d, an imaginary journey through hell, purgatory, and heaven, shortly before his death in 1321.\nExile is a major theme in the book, which also offered Dante the chance for some personal score-settling: in it, he made sure to find a place in hell for Boniface VIII and his other earthly foes.\nExperts have long agreed that Dante was the victim of biased judges.\nBut Alessandro Barbero, Italy\u2019s most famous medieval historian, recently suggested that certain charges against him may have had some substance.\nDante definitely did not take bribes, but it is \u201cnot exactly impossible\u201d to imagine he exploited his role in office to favor his political allies, Barbero wrote in a recent biography.\nTraversi hopes to set the record straight on this \u2014 and dispel any doubts about Dante\u2019s rectitude.\nHis conference will be one of several events honoring the poet on the 700th anniversary of his death \u2014 most set to be celebrated in a rather subdued fashion due to coronavirus restrictions.\n\u201cWe hope to do it in person, but we are ready to do it remotely if necessary,\u201d the Florentine lawyer said.\nMargherita Cassano, a judge from the Court of Cassation, Italy\u2019s supreme court, will draft a final report from the conference, and all deliberations will be published in a book, Traversi said.\nHowever, Serego Alighieri \u2014 the descendant who not only carries Dante\u2019s name but also shares with him the distinctive family trait of an aquiline nose \u2014 noted it all came a little late.\n\u201cDante was convicted, he went into exile, he was exiled all his life, he never returned to Florence,\u201d he told AFP.\n\u201cAnything that can be done for him (today) will not change any of that.\u201d\n"}, {"author": "vcatibog", "title":
